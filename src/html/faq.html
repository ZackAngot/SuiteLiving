                    <p><strong></strong><strong>Q: What is Assisted Living?</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A:</strong> </span>An assisted living facility offers all the services resident require to remain independent. We provide three meals daily, 24 hour nursing supervision, daily activities, housekeeping and laundry services and social interaction with peers. We are not a nursing home, but can provide services to keep our residents as independent as possible.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong></strong><strong>Q: What kinds of rooms do you have?</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A:</strong> </span>At Suite Living we offer two bedroom independent apartments, one bedroom assisted living suites as well as studio suites. Our Independent Living apartments are designed for active seniors who want lots of space but do not want the headaches of home ownership. At Suite Living we mow the grass, shovel the snow and take care of all the home maintenance. In our Assisted Living facility, each suite is equipped with a kitchenette, full bathroom with walk-in shower, and an emergency call system to notify our nursing staff of any needs a resident may have.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A:</strong> </span>Absolutely Not! At Suite Living, each resident signs a lease agreement designed for their specific situation. We do require a $800.00 security deposit which is refundable at the end of the lease period.</p>

                    <p><strong></strong><strong>Q: Can we rent month to month?</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A:</strong> </span>Absolutely! Again, we want our residents to have the flexibility they need to feel safe and secure. A month to month option is available as well as a Respite Option which is for residents who want to try out our services before committing to a longer lease period.</p>
