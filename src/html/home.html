                <p>Suite Living was the first free standing assisted living facility to open in Grant County. The owners have a long history of working in the senior care industry and wanted to develop a facility that provided all the daily needs of seniors, and allowed for their maximum independence. Local contractors were used almost exclusively during the construction process and have built a beautiful facility on ten acres of land in Pleasant township of Grant County. The facility has 50 assisted living apartments and 20 independent living apartments. 2018 marks our community's 20th anniversary!</p>
