                    <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span>My wife and I moved to Suite Living in order to be close to family. We started out in the Indpendent Apartments where we lived for several years. When our needs changed, we moved into the Assisted Living facility where we could receive more services. It is move we have never regretted.</p>
